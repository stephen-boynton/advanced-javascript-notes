# Don't Repeat Yourself

Abstraction and DRY Coding. DRY stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself". Refactor and
clean up your code.

Abstraction helps you from repeating yourself. The idea of Abstraction is that
"each signifiant piece of functionality should be implemented in just one
place."

If you are having trouble naming a function, there's a good chance you need to
abstract.
