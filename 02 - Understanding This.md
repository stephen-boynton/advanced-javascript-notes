# this

`this` is determined at runtime. Depending on the code, it may be something different.

`this` is:
* Established at runtime, when a function is invoked
* determined by the type of invocation
* a reference to an object

`this` is not:
* The function. Though it is established when the function is invoked, it is not the function.
